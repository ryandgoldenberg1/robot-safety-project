# Distributional Shift in Robotic Manipulation

This repository contains the code for the Columbia Fall 2019 course COMS 6998 Topics in Robotic Learning. The goal of the project is to develop safe RL approaches to deal with distributional shift in robotic manipulation. The code under `ai_safety_gridworlds` is forked from [this](https://github.com/deepmind/ai-safety-gridworlds) repository.
